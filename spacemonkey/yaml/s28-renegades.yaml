          This should be a very good weapon for PvP - I'm pretty excited about
          this one. I'm treating it for now like it's a normal rapid-fire but
          the heat element may factor in in a negative way, so we'll have to
          see.

          This is a really hard weapon to evaluate for both PvE and PvP as it is
          our only Balanced Heat weapon (at least until the dungeon comes out).
          Remember that Balanced weapons need to be manually reloaded/vented
          just before overheating to get the massive reload bonus. If you're
          good at that little minigame then this is the best Peacekeepers DPS
          roll in the kinetic slot (you really want Accelerated Assault for that
          purpose). This is probably just fine in roam content so if you enjoy
          it go ahead. For PvP this could be quite good or excessively mediocre.
          It has the rolls for it, just a question of how the frame performs.
          After doing some testing basically any target lock fast talker with
          accelerated assault is slightly superior to antedate for peacekeepers
          dps. With that in mind if you go attrition orbs then you'll be
          consistently getting some good utility while doing a solid rotation.
          That being said cooling baubles has the potential to go absolutely
          nuts if you can pick up some orbs or elemental pickups while strafing
          and shooting: we're talking like 2-5x longer single mag than either
          antedate or a non-baubles fast talker. So the way to look at it is
          that cooling baubles won't always work, but the gun at base will still
          be slightly better than an antedate and it has the potential to every
          once in awhile go nuts on dps. Conversely attrition orbs has a lower
          ceiling but will more consistently pump out utility. Both good
          options, just depends on your roll and your personal preference.

          This is ostensibly a better version of the best PvE hand cannon
          archetype. The only thing it is missing is a damage perk, but it has
          some decent utility and splash. With the inherent good damage profile
          of hand cannons, the bonus of being a heat weapon, and being the best
          archetype of hand cannons - this should be a very solid candidate for
          all PvE content.

          This is now the best sidearm in the game. The archetype is not the
          strongest for either sidearms or the dynamic heat family, but the perk
          combination and the natural strength of the sidearms (highest damage
          primary weapons) can't be beat. This is a very impressive primary
          weapon. No other blaster from this season really rewards you as
          demonstrably as this one does for using the Dynamic Heat Limiter proc
          in just general play.

          A cool new weapon type but sadly pretty pigeonholed in usage. It is
          the best Lucky Pants hand cannon by a wiiiiide margin now, especially
          if you can pick up an Accelerated Assault roll. Outside of that in PvE
          it's basically just a worse sniper rifle, and special snipers have had
          a rough time in PvE for a while now. In PvP this thing melts - it's
          basically a better Forerunner.

          This gun is so cool. Hits like an absolute truck and is supported so
          nicely by the artifact this season - and all of that in addition to
          being a perfect pairing for the Praxic Blade which is also Kinetic and
          allows you to double dip your surges. You really want Accelerated
          Assault here - as is the case with any DPS focused weapon this season.
          Perk 1 slot is basically just a big whiff, so it's kinda whatever you
          personally want. I like Bewildering Burst because I like the
          availability of the extra crowd control if I want it, but in general a
          perk focused on landing your crits as fast as possible is probably the
          best option for most people. Overall you want to juice your reload
          stat as much as possible.

          This is mostly pretty underwhelming. This weapon is pretty

          it being better than many weapons it is competing against. Adhesive
          Ordnance is nifty at least.

          This is an interesting Chill Clip vehicle, but otherwise is pretty

          Especially with the nerf to Shatter effects Chill Clip is not what it

          I'm pretty baffled as to why this was released not only alongside two
          stasis fusion from last season and another one this season - and one
          of those being Lionfish, which was just a Riptide replacement. As it
          stands this gun has BiS rolls for both PvE and PvP and is a major
          beneficiary of the Accelerated Assault origin trait - which makes this
          blow Lionfish out of the water.

          At first glance this looks pretty underwhelming, and tbh given its
          archetype it kind of is. However it isn't all doom and gloom. This can
          get a rather interesting DPS roll, which obviously you want to pair
          with the Accelerated Assault origin trait. This precise roll will be
          very rare, and niche in use case, so don't sweat it if you can't get
          this.

          The best archetype of the best primary family. Right away this is an
          incredible option before we even get to the perks. And even then the
          perks do not disappoint for either PvP or PvE. The only thing holding
          this gun back is the lackluster ammo gen stat, but that doesn't seem
          to be an issue for this season really.

          One of my all-time favorite PvP guns and it can get the exact roll
          that it used to. For PvE it's a little less exciting, but it's a
          perfectly decent arc pulse workhorse, especially with overload pulse
          being in the artifact this season. With accelerated assault you don't
          really need anything from the perk 1 column, so it's just kinda
          whatever you want there.

          Another aggressive that is not quite Igneous Hammer, but it's New Gear
          and can get some nifty tricks Igneous couldn't get. While being
          statistically inferior to Crimil's Dagger as well it can get the same
          roll everyone has been loving on that gun and can be used in a
          different slot AND is New Gear, if that matters to you.

          This is not Mint Retrograde. No Rewind Rounds and no Bait & Switch
          means that is pretty much fundamentally not a universally applicable
          and solitary DPS weapon - at least not until the shiny origin trait -
          Accelerated Assault - gets fixed on this. The only real situation
          where that could have been true is one Storm's Keep titan since
          trickle charge will automatically fill the mag behind the barricade,
          except the only real DPS perk is Elemental Honing… which hates being
          on a true subclass since the options to stack up different elements
          are so limited. That being said, as a supplemental DPS option in a
          rotation, especially on a prismatic subclass that can take advantage
          of multiple elements easily, this can definitely find a home. Overall
          it's a weapon that hits very hard and should be good for general
          content and even some higher end content where you just want any
          rocket pulse and this frees up the kinetic slot.

          Not in love with the perk combos for this crossbow tbh. Withering Gaze
          is cool, but is it worth the heavy slot? Repulsor + Destab combo from
          the heavy slot is interesting, but worth it? And the lack of
          Autoloader is pretty sad. As part of a DPS rotation it should be good,
          but I'd prefer something that had a bit more general usage.

          Grip instead of origin trait hurts in PvE, but this gun is so unique
          and so cool that it's worth it even without one. The main reason that
          this gun isn't DOA for PvE is because bungie actually custom tuned the
          damage scalars for red bars and elites to be higher than the rest of
          the SMG family, so it actually winds up being one of the strongest
          weapons for the season. The obvious and most direct comparison is to
          THE Multimach roll - Attrition Orbs & Kinetic Tremors. While Multimach
          procs both effects faster, Peculiar Charm simply does more damage. In
          a vacuum I'd probably still take Multimach, but with the New Gear
          bonus active the draw of Peculiar Charm is too strong this season. PvP
          is a different story but a similar ending. This is actually pretty
          good there, having crazy range for an SMG and being pretty forgiving.
          Fitted Stock seems to be super important, along with as much range
          stat as possible.

          GLs aren't in meta right now, and this has the exact same roll as like
          6 other grenade launchers. Keep the god roll so you have it in your
          vault in case it ever comes back around in the next year, but I
          wouldn't bet on it.

          A very good void primary. The lack of an origin trait stings, but it's
          better than a lot of our other New Gear options.

          Micro-missile breech GLs are pretty much exclusive to movement tech
          these days, so I'm not going to get into any kind of add clear roll
          here until I see something that makes me think it'll be worth it. The
          recommendations are going to be for vertical movement tech. And then
          separately for DPS in case it winds up being worth it for swap.

          Pretty underwhelming. The only cool thing this bow had going for it
          was if Explosive Head would count as 2 hits which would proc jolt from
          jolting feedback in 1 shot if you were amplified. Sadly that does not
          work. Also, sadly this does not get the Accelerated Assault origin
          trait on shiny versions, so there is basically no reason to chase this
          unless you really like bows and want one that is New Gear.

          It's a glaive. It's a pretty good glaive, all things considered, but
          it's still a very niche audience that will want this particular
          weapon.
