          At base this is a decent rapid-fire sniper with good dps perks. That alone would
          have made this a chase-worthy addition to any arsenal. But to top it off this is
          a dynamic heat weapon, so if you time your reload/second mag dump correctly you
          can double your magazine size for free, leading to excellent total damage and a
          DPS value that is truly noteworthy. This is one of the best weapons in the game.

          This has some interesting rolls but it isn't a worldbreaker. Sadly destabilizing
          wound up in the wrong column, so it can't get the classic combo that would have
          pushed it over the edge. As a blaster-type weapon this will of course feel great.

          Precision autos are not very good right now, but this weapon is saved by being a
          blaster and just naturally being better than every other auto rifle basically.
          Overall this is a fine weapon. Burning Ambition is also decent for supporting a
          hellion warlock build, much like Ahab Char.

          The idea of a blaster machine gun with built in reconstruction (via cooling) is
          very cool. However column 1 misses so hard for this gun it's hard to reconcile.
          With trickle charge this gun is kind of a baby thunderlord when shooting from
          behind a storm's keep barricade, but that's a very specific use case. Overall
          this should be a good gun, just like all the weapons from the dungeon, but it
          could have been better.

          Very cool sword, especially this season with all the support for swords in the
          artifact. The double damage perks here are great, and make this a good "no setup
          required" heavy sword DPS option. Eager Edge is probably the actual draw here
          though as the sword gets way more ammo at base than other frames and the light
          attack is both a faster animaton and more aggressive forward momentum.
