          This is about two or three years too late. A great looking add clear and utility GL,
          held back by the fact that area denial frames exist and invalidate this thing's entire
          purpose. Honestly, this still ticks a lot of boxes for me personally, so I'll be going
          for one in the hopes that the archetype can make a comeback.

          Terrible archetype and worst-in-class ammo gen stat. Pretty disappointing but is still
          a totally serviceable sidearm for arc enthusiasts.

          LFRs are pretty terrible right now, but if they were to come back into meta this is a
          legitimate contender with Scintillation as the most viable option. The utility
          potential of having withering gaze in the first column paired with a damage perk is
          honestly pretty intriguing.
