          This looks great on paper. The archetype is fantastic and there are a
          plethora of good perks here. The bad news is that it basically doesn't
          have an origin trait for PvE, and it doesn't get Attrition Orbs paired
          with Kinetic Tremors, so it will never be as good as Multimach.
          Attrition Orbs paired with Bewildering Burst is pretty cool, but sadly
          relies on getting a kill first, which means that it doesn't have
          enough “out of the box” play. That being said, of the 3 weapons this
          one is definitely the winner.

          Pretty underwhelming. This has the same issue that all strand
          primaries have, where the perks they have access to are just not very
          good. And like all bows you need a very good roll in order for it to
          feel at all okay at a baseline. The one benefit is that it does have
          access to Wild Card, which is not a bad origin trait for PvE. The ammo
          gen stat here is terrible though, so this probably becomes straight up
          useless.

          One of the random, weird new shotgun archetypes that someone at bungie
          keeps trying to make happen. The base gun is pretty useless, but the
          perk combos it can get aren't bad. If Bungie ever decides to buff this
          archetype then we could be looking at a legitimate dps threat.
