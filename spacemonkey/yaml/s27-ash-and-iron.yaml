          At first glance this is a precision scout rifle so it would be easy to
          write it off as dead on arrival, however the addition of some new
          perks - notably Bewildering Burst - gives this gun some much needed
          utility that could actually push this into relevance. Outside of that
          this straight up powercreeps Hung Jury as well. Ancillary Ordinance is
          actually pretty strong as well.

          One of the worst elements of one of the worst archetypes of the worst
          weapon family is not a good place to start out. There are some
          interesting new perks but the base gun they're attached to is too
          heavy to be carried. And the ammo gen stat here is bad.

          It's back and it's pretty decent. This gun has never been a good
          pairing with Sturm, and it still isn't. Even with Disruption Break in
          the first column it still doesn't justify running double primary.
          Sidearms are the highest damage weapon family in the game, so Sturm
          will kind of always play second fiddle to this anyway. As a standalone
          weapon though this is totally legitimate - albeit not very unique.

          One of the best elements of the best archetype of this weapon family
          is a good place to start. That being said this is basically just a
          sidegrade from Yeartide Apex released earlier this same season. The
          synergy this shares with MIDA Multi-Tool doesn't really matter since
          you wouldn't run two primaries anyway and the MIDA Multi-Tool rework
          looks pretty terrible in PvE regardless.

          Terrible in PvE, the frame is just bad. And that's ok because we won't
          miss the MIDA Multi-Tool synergy there. However, both of these guns
          look pretty decent in PvP, and MIDA Macro has the rolls to back it up.
          This looks like a legitimately good pairing.

          Not sure why this wound up with such a mediocre perk pool compared to

          Very unique and interesting weapon. The actual configuration of the
          gun is pretty random, and mostly determined by the Bolts column. You
          can make it deal explosive damage to help with add clear, have the
          bolt itself deal extra damage, have it apply a damage-over-time
          effect, to name a few. The Rail column mostly just gives nice stats,
          including the new persistence stat that determines how long the bolts
          last in the environment before expiring. Unfortunately in the case of
          the DoT effect from Charged Bolts the Persistence stat does not
          benefit like it should. Also, bolts can be collected after shooting
          them (and in the case of Serrated Bolts deals damage when you remove
          them from an enemy), which means this is a legendary heavy weapon with
          technically infinite ammo! Aggregate Charge is an interesting damage
          perk.

          this is a fantastic frame for it to be on. The last of a real origin
